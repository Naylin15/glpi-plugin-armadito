Tests

> Itâ€™s overwhelmingly easy to write bad unit tests that add very little value to a project while inflating the cost of code changes astronomically.

In contrast, we use integration tests to avoid regression.
Consequently, Travis-CI has been configured in order to do all these integration tests regularly.
