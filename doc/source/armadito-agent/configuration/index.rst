Configuration
=============

Agent configuration is basically quite the same on each platform.
However, its emplacment differs because the installation process differs.


On linux, configuration files are stored by default in :

::

    /usr/local/etc/armadito-agent


On windows, configuration files are stored by default in :

::

    C:\\Program Files\\Armadito-Agent\\etc


There is two main configurations files :

* **agent.cfg**
* **scheduler-X.cfg**


.. note:: *.new files are the new configuration files installed when your update armadito-agent. It is done that way to avoid erasing previous configuration.
