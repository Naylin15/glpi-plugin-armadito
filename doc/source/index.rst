=================
Armadito for GLPI
=================

Armadito for GLPI is an open-source solution to manage computer antiviruses on IT infrastructures. It is firstly designed to manage computers with Armadito Antivirus installed.
This solution can be divided into two subprojects :

* **armadito-agent** : client-side part installed on each managed computer.
* **armadito-glpi**  : server-side part developed as a plugin for GLPI.

.. warning:: armadito-agent and armadito-glpi are still development versions. Also, all features are not yet implemented. This is a work in progress.
